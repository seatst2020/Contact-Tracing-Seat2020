Update the contact tracing program so that it takes in a the data from the database and a random student from that data, and can output a list of infected students. Each student has an ordered schedule. Find out if a student shares any class with the infected student.

Examples
~~~python

Notes
  Databases are randomly generated.
  You will be given a predetermined list for the pytest.

To test your function using the tests I created, do the following:
Open the command shell by pressing Cmd+Shift+S on MacOS or Ctrl+Shift+S on other computers. Note that this is different from the Python output pane that's open by default. The command shell will open up below the Python one, as shown below.

Type in pytest and press Enter. You should receive the output below if you passed the tests:
============= 2 passed in 0.02s ==============
